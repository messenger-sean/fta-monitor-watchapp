# FTA Monitor
This application is designed to allow FTAs and FTAAs to monitor field status and take notes on teams, matches, and events.

Screenshots can be found in the screenshots directory, which has shots of both the Android app the companion Pebble WatchApp.

Features:
* Display the Field Monitor on your Android Phone
* Updates while the screen is off, so there is no refresh lag when turning on your phone
* Monitors teams for issues, and notifies you when an issue is detected, such as a team dropping out at any point during the match or exceeding bandwidth limits.
* If you have a Pebble, there is a companion WatchApp for the Pebble that will display the Field Monitor statuses, and vibrate when a team's status changes.
* Can display the Field Monitor on your lock screen, so you don't have to unlock your phone to see the current field status.
